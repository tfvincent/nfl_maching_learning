# NFL Game Ratings Analysis

This project aims to leverage data analytics techniques to enhance the NFL's game ratings by identifying the key factors that contribute to viewer engagement and satisfaction. By gaining insights into the drivers of game ratings, the NFL can optimize the overall game experience, attracting and retaining a broader audience.

## Project Overview

The National Football League (NFL) faces challenges in consistently delivering captivating and engaging game experiences that resonate with fans and viewers. This project seeks to address these challenges by analyzing historical game data and identifying patterns and trends that correlate with high and low game ratings.

## Data

The project utilizes comprehensive datasets containing historical game data, including game statistics, team performance, player metrics, and game ratings. The data is preprocessed, cleaned, and prepared for analysis.

## Approach

The project follows a structured approach to achieve its objectives:

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Gather and preprocess the game data, addressing any missing values or inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the game data.
3. **Feature Selection and Engineering**: Utilize feature selection techniques and engineer new features to capture complex relationships and interactions between game attributes.
4. **Model Building and Evaluation**: Develop and evaluate predictive models to understand the impact of various features on game ratings.
5. **Insights Generation and Recommendations**: Analyze and interpret feature importance to extract actionable insights and generate recommendations for strategic interventions and improvements.

## Key Findings

Through the analysis, the following key findings have been identified:

- **Team Ratings**: The overall ratings of the teams involved in a game significantly impact game ratings, with higher-rated teams attracting more viewers.
- **Quarterback Performance**: The performance of the starting quarterbacks, measured by metrics such as passer rating and yards gained, is a crucial factor in determining game ratings.
- **Game Probabilities**: Pre-game probabilities and odds, which reflect the perceived competitiveness of a game, influence viewer interest and game ratings.

## Recommendations

Based on the insights gained from this analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Game Scheduling**: Strategically schedule games involving highly rated teams and star players to maximize viewer interest and ratings.
2. **Promotion and Marketing**: Enhance promotional efforts and marketing campaigns to highlight marquee matchups, star players, and compelling storylines.
3. **Player Development**: Invest in player development programs to cultivate and nurture talent, ensuring a consistent supply of talented and exciting players.
4. **Rule Adjustments**: Consider minor rule adjustments or experimental tweaks to enhance the excitement and competitiveness of games, if deemed appropriate.
